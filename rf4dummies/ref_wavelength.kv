        title: tr._("Wavelength")
        text: tr._("The wavelength and the frequency are related to one another. In fact, the wavelength may be calculated directly from the frequency using the equation λ=c/f, where  λ is the wavelength, c is the speed of light and f is the frequency of the wave. It is important to know the wavelength in order to choose an antenna with the right characteristics (length, in the case of a dipole). Additionally, when installing an antenna, particularly for short-range transmissions, the wavelength is important to know in order to avoid a null, which repeats periodically each wavelength distance from the transmitter.")
