# KivyMD Test App

Install the required packages and run main.py

A way to package the application into an Android APK is to use buildozer. It might only work under Linux (on macOS I could build a basic Kivy app but not with kivyMD) and I think Windows is not supported (although [I've seen it work with WSL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7iRNO013D8)).

An easy alternative is to do it using [Google Colab](ttps://colab.research.google.com/github/Spidy20/Python_To_APK/blob/master/android_app.ipynb) (that's how I did it).
